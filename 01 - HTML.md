# HTML

HTML should be clean and free of unnecessary clutter. This includes layers of wrapper elements, div soup, and controls that are better suited to CSS or JavaScript.

SymbioCSS tackles this issue by following these rules:

1. HTML tags should be chosen based on their semantic value to the user.
2. No unnecessary containers or wrappers should be used.
3. HTML should contain all the context necessary to describe the document to the user, and NO MORE.
4. class attributes should be used to add needed semantics. The class name should be semantic in the context of the user
5. id attributes should only be added for JavaScript targeting or CSS targeting of container elements that do not have meaningful context to the user.
