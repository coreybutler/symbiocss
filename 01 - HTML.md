# HTML

HTML should be clean and free of unnecessary clutter. HTML elements with descriptors like "wrapper," "green" or "col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-9 cf h30 wrapper-main__header--v2" are not particularly conducive to communication amongst a team of developers. Any team member must be trained on what each of these descriptors mean, and even then it may not be entirely obvious which UI elements these descriptors refer to. Cluttered HTML is bad enough, but it is made even worse when it is indecipherable.
